## 📄File Handling

### Text Files

Efficiently read from and write to text files, ensuring proper handling of file operations.

### 📊CSV Files

Manipulate CSV files using Python's `csv` module, enabling easy reading, writing, and processing of CSV data.

### 📂JSON Files

Parse and handle JSON files with Python's `json` module, ensuring smooth data interchange between systems.

## 📦Modules

### Custom Modules

Organize and reuse code through custom modules, showcasing modular programming practices.

### Built-in Modules

Leverage Python's built-in modules to enhance functionality and simplify complex tasks.

## 🔧Built-in Functions

### Map

Apply functions to all items in a list using the `map()` function for efficient data processing.

### Reduce

Perform cumulative operations on data using the `reduce()` function from the `functools` module.

### Filter

Extract elements from lists based on conditions with the `filter()` function for effective data filtering.

### Zip

Combine multiple lists into tuples using the `zip()` function, facilitating parallel iteration.

### Enumerate

Access both index and value in loops with the `enumerate()` function for improved loop control.

## ⚠️Error Handling

Implement robust error handling using try-except blocks, including creating custom exceptions to manage specific error scenarios.

## 🔎Regular Expressions

Utilize the `re` module to perform advanced pattern matching and searching within strings, enabling complex text processing.

## 🔤File Encoding

Handle various file encodings properly, ensuring compatibility and accurate data representation across different systems.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to handle files, use modules, and apply essential built-in functions in Python effectively. Explore the code to see these concepts in action and gain insights into practical Python programming.

Happy coding! 🚀
